<strong>Inspec</strong> is an web application I made as my first project on my own.<br/>My work currently uses an Excel spread sheet with lots of files for
all the different materials we deal with.<br/>I wanted to make an easier way for people to search through and print out an spec sheet if needed.  

TODO<br/>
1)Create an way to update an spec with an login.<br/>
2)Create an way to create a new material or degree.<br/>

<strong>Inspec</strong> is an web application I made as my first project on my own.<br/>My work currently uses an Excel spread sheet with lots of files for
all the different materials we deal with.<br/>I wanted to make an easier way for people to search through and print out an spec sheet if needed.

TODO<br/>
1)Add way to update wheels<br/>
2)Add a way to create new users<br/>
3)Add a way to create new blades<br/>
